function [amp, pd, td] = phase_delay(rs, bs, t, fm, df, points)
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% pd:	calculate phase (pd) and time (td) delay between received signal (rs) and base signal (bs) 
% also calculates the amplitude (amp) of the fm-fourirer component
%
% Input:
% rs - set of received signals
% bs - set of base signals
% t  - set of time points
% fm - the frequency of the fourier-harmonic under interest
% df - maximum possible dispersion of the fm (the disperion can occur due time-
% 	instability of a modulator)
% points - numbers of the time points, where the useful signal is
